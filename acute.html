     <h2>*Overview</h2>
     <p>The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.</p>
     <p>Healthy adults can expect to have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have even more frequent colds.</p>
     <p>Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Generally, you don't need medical attention for a common cold. However, if symptoms don't improve or if they get worse, see your doctor.</p>
